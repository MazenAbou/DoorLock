High Priority:
1 - Basic Authentication System
    a) Keypad input for passcode entry.
    b) Fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication.
2 - Lock Mechanism
    a) Connect and control solenoid lock/servo motor.
    b) Ensure the lock securely engages/disengages upon authentication.
3 - Power System
    a) Main power supply (adapter or battery).
    b) Implement low-power mode to optimize energy consumption.
4 - Basic Feedback System
    a) Display status messages (successful unlock, incorrect passcode, etc.).
    b) Use buzzer/LEDs for confirmation and alerts.
    
Medium Priority (Security & Usability Enhancements)
1 - Store passcodes and fingerprint data securely in EEPROM/flash memory.
2 - Maintain logs of unlock attempts (successful and failed).
3 - Implement a backup power source for operation during power failure.

Low Priority
1 - Optional Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity to unlock remotely.
2 - Use vibration or magnetic sensors to detect forced entry attempts.
3 - Allow storing multiple fingerprints and passcodes for different users.
