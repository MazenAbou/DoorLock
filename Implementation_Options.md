The Smart Safe system can be implemented using different architectures based on the level of security, complexity, and scalability required. 

Option 1: Microcontroller-Based (Arduino).
Pros:
Simple and cost-effective.
Low power consumption.
Ideal for standalone operation.
Cons:
Limited storage for logging access.
No built-in remote access without additional modules.
Architecture:
Microcontroller 
  -  Arduino as the central processing unit.
  -  Keypad & Fingerprint Sensor as input.
  -  Solenoid Lock/Servo Motor.
  -  LCD Display for feedback.
  -  EEPROM/Flash Memory to store credentials.

Option 2: Raspberry Pi-Based.
Pros:
- More processing power and storage.
- Allows for network-based control (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cloud integration).
Cons:
- Higher power consumption.
- More complex software development.
Architecture:
- Raspberry Pi as the processing unit.
- Touchscreen UI (Optional) instead of a keypad.
- Cloud-based authentication (Optional).

Option 3: Standalone ATmega328P (Without Arduino Board).
  Pros:
- Smaller and cheaper than a full Arduino board.
- More customizable and power-efficient for production use.
- Works well for battery-powered applications.
  Cons:
- Requires external components (crystal oscillator, capacitors, voltage regulator).
- Harder to debug compared to an Arduino board.
  Architecture:
- ATmega328P microcontroller (flashed with Arduino bootloader).
- External 16MHz crystal oscillator with capacitors.
- Manual wiring for inputs (keypad, fingerprint sensor, lock mechanism).
- EEPROM or Flash memory for storing credentials.
- Power regulation circuit (if using external battery).
